<p>
    I am Aadishree Bais,
    I am loving coding and maybe in future,
    I would take coding as my profession.
    Coding turned to be really cool and interesting,
    but before trying coding ,I was really nervous,
    but my mom pushed me from my corfort zone and made me do it.
    I actually performed so well that I came in 2%,
    and I got scholarship.

    It was shocking and exciting,
    My journey of coding because of my mom and her believe.
    Thanking mom amd my teacher,
    I came across alot.

    I feel really good and proud,
    finishing this link.

    Really happy with myself,
    and education.
